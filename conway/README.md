# Conway's Game of Life

[Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) has always been on top of the list of alogrithms that I want to implement. It's so simple but so fascinating to witness in action. Definitely recommend you write an implementation of it yourself to appreciate it.
